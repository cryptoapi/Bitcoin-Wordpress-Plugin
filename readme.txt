=  When I clicked the 'Open Wallet' button in the Bitcoin Payment Box I got an error message - 'The address wasn't understood because one of the following protocols (for bitcoin) isn't associated with any program' = 

GoUrl uses a standard Bitcoin URI. Clicking a Bitcoin URI should launch a preferred wallet, pre-populating a payment transaction with data pulled from the link. Some browsers still do not recognise bitcoins links. If your browser does not recognise the bitcoin link, simply use 'Copy address' button and manually copy address and the amount to pay in your Bitcoin wallet.

Yes, we offer [Free Technical Support](https://gourl.io/view/contact/Contact_Us.html) and [Bitcoin/Altcoins Affiliate Program](https://gourl.io/affiliate-bitcoin-wordpress-plugins.html) for web developers
